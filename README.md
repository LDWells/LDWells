Hi, my name is LaDarion. I started off college as a mechanical engineer major and left a computer science major. I have also undergone training as a Quality Assurance Engineer Tester and will be continuing to expand my knowledge. This profile consists of some past projects with my time at University of Denver on top of recent projects from the training and projects I will incorporate on my own.
